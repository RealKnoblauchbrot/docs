# Learn scripting for FiveM!

FiveM offers three different programming languages when you want to write your own scripts,
Lua, JavaScript and C#.

Lua offers the most learning ressources regarding FiveM and simultaneously is blazing fast. JavaScript offers the most learning resources outside of FiveM, it also is 
[number 1 on github's most active languages](https://githut.info/). \
Since the most used language on FiveM is Lua we will talk about Lua here, and some Front-End developement options to make things like UI using HTML, CSS and Lua

## Lua
Lua is a simple programming language that is used in many different areas, including video games, network programs, industrial programs, and task automation. It’s popular because it’s easy to learn and use, and it’s fast and efficient.

## Front-End (UI/HUD)
FiveM uses a feature called NUI(short for 'new UI'), which allows developers to create user interfaces for their scripts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This means you can create things like menus, scoreboards, or huds that show things like the player's money. It's like designing a website, but for a game. 
The best part is that you can use all the cool features of these web technologies to make your game look and feel exactly how you want it to.
