# Cfx.re Element Club

The `Cfx.re Element Club` is a <DefinitionText text={"Patreon"}/>-based subscription service that provides access to additional features to use on your server.

The subscription is often referred to as an `EUP key`. *however*, the benefits are not a separate key,
but rather, are applied to your existing <DefinitionText text={"Keymaster"}/> license keys, allowing you to use the features on all your servers.

    You Can subscribe by visiting the [Cfx.re <DefinitionText text={"Patreon"}/>](https://www.patreon.com/join/fivem).
